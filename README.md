# quantum4_SoilErosionDetection
Soil erosion detection

I added the jupyter notebook with data analysis named SoilErosion_Analysis, where I working with rasterio and Geaopandas libraries, to make the mask of the soil corrosion.
Also I added SoilErosion_Modeling.ipynb where I build Neural Network model, that has to work as soil corrosion detector. It is interesting and large subject, and I hope in the future I can get deeper into it.
