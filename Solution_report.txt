To solve the problem of detecting soil erosion, we need a large amount of marked-up data, and the data must be collected under similar climatic and weather conditions.

Machine learning models can be applied both to predict the risk of soil erosion and to identify the factors that contribute to this process. One of the functions of a model may be to recognize soil type. And the analysis of soil erosion risk will be done only for certain soil types.

Since the process of detecting soil erosion can be classified as a data segmentation problem, it may be worth trying to use a U-Net architecture or a similar one. Also, a GAN architecture should be good for such a task.
